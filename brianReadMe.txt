I was responsible for the middle section of concepts, ten in total:

Naming variables in JavaScript
Camel casing
Prefix/Postfix operator in JS
Conditional (if): Single Select statement
Conditional (if): Two-way selection statement
Conditional (if): Multi-way selection statement
Switch Statement in JS
Ternary operator in JavaScript
For Loop, JavaScript
While Loop, JavaScript

I contributed by creating the cards for the aforementioned concepts. I added code to the html document for these cards, and also added some specific bits to our CSS file for my cards. Specifically, I added classes for smaller text and smallest text, as I discovered pretty quickly that the default text our group was using was going to be too large for a handful of the cards due to the amount of content. I also added some unordered list formatting (removing bullet points) and a smaller title font for one card.

Our group has set up a Discord channel, which we use to plan and chat about the assignment. We also use replit for the initial skeleton of the page, so that we are all able to see and work on it.
