# My Contributions
I created the initial site and added the necessary framework such as the header, board, and footer. 
I also created the intital structure for the flip cards themselves. Of course, I created the 
styling for these components as well.

# Our Communication Method
Our group utilized discord as our main method of communications. We used the various channels
to let eachother know about our individual progress.
